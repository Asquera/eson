# Eson - a bare metal client for ElasticSearch in Ruby

Eson is an ElasticSearch client for everyone that wants to use the full power of ElasticSearch, but doesn't care about integrations. Eson implements the full ElasticSearch API and provides a complete generator for the ElasticSearch query DSL. It is implemented in multiple subprojects which can be used independently.
